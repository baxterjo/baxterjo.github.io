		<p>This project was my very first development task. Written in C using the <a href="http://openframeworks.cc/">openframeworks API</a>, <br/> "Everything but Aliens" was a headfirst dive into version control and workflow on a new project <br/> using a language learned only weeks before the deadline. While this was technically a solo project, <br/> the intro to computer science class stayed very collaborative and were constantly working to <br/> improve each otherâ€™s code. Source code for "Everything but Aliens" can be found <a href="https://github.com/jbaxter25/TermProject">here</a>.</p>
