        <h4>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h4>
        <p>This project was the culmination of several miniature projects completed over the course of a class called 
            "System Design with Microcontrollers." A class which is infamous among OSU students and alumni as being one of the most difficult classes in the ECE program. 
            The final device is an FM alarm clock with local and remote temperature sensors all build by hand!</p>

        <h4>THE BRAINS OF THE OPERATION</h4>
        <p>For this project, the bulk of the computing and I/O power lay in this custom ATMega-128 microcontroller breakout board. This is a standard lab board given to all ECE students at some point in their journey at Oregon State. 
          Some saw it first in lower level electronics classes, but I received mine for the first time in assembly language and computer architecture. The only other &microC used in this project is for a remote temperature sensor, but more on that later.<br><br>
          All development done for this project was in a Linux environment. I am a native Windows user, so this meant heavy use of a virtual machine to get the job done.</p>

        <h4>START SIMPLE</h4>
        <p>The first mini-project for this class was simple, set up the tool chain. This may seem trivial to many. But since this was my first time developing in a Linux environment, I had to hit the ground running to keep up.<br><br>
          After that we had another seemingly small task: get the 7-segment display and buttons working. The LED display on the front works using a multiplexer and persistance of vision. 
          Meaning only one of the digits is on at any given time. This required the use of a timer interrupt to ensure the correct duty cycle. This same timer was also used to manually debounce the buttons.
          This was done by checking the buttons once every 2ms and looking for a certain number of active states in a row.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
        <h4>BUILD UPON SUCCESS</h4>
        <p>After the display and button debouncing were complete, we were to add the rotary encoders and light bar to the display, these were interfaced to the &microC via SPI. 
          Now, I only had to write to the light bar and read from the encoders. This meant that I could perform the operation simultaneously, by writing to both devices simultaneously 
          and only connecting the encoders to the MISO net, this meant that I was only performing one SPI operation to perform two tasks!<br>The second large problem of this mini-project was 
          developing a finite state machine (FSM) for the rotary encoders. The ATMega-128 is a fine piece of hardware with great documentation, and highly reliable architecture. But it lacks certain
          quality of life features that you might see in a more modern &micro;C. This meant defining my own FSM for the encoders. This FSM tracks the past state of the encoders and compares it to the current state. 
          Also tracked is their assumed direction based on the starting position compared to the first change seen. The resulting FSM was very robust and ensured the encoder actions were only
          performed on a solid 'click' in either direction.</p>

        <h4>STARTING TO LOOK LIKE A CLOCK<br>(DEFINITELY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A BOMB)</h4>
        <p>Up until this point, my clock didn't keep time. This portion of the project remedies that and then some! This mini-project saw the addition of time setting, 
            time keeping, and alarm setting. But what is the point of setting an alarm unless you know when it's going off? Oh yea, this mini-project also had me building a pre-amp
            for an audio amplifier that made a square wave alarm sound produced by a timer and an I/O pin. This portion of the clock was by-far the most challenging part of the project.</p>
