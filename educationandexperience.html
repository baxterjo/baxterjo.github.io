          Embedded Systems and Hardware<br>
          Apricity Consulting<br>
          FEB 2016 - Present</h4>

        <p><a href="https://apricitycode.com/">Apricity Consulting</a> is a small embedded systems and IoT solutions start up located in Bend, Oregon. 
          Their diverse client list and wealth of knowledge straight from MIT engineers gave me a crash course into the professional engineering world.
          My ongoing professional relationship with Apricity has given me the opportunity to complete several projects for them.</p>

        <h5>Responsibilities at Apricity:</h5>

        <p>-Daily use of Autodesk Fusion 360 and Eagle PCB CAD software<br>
          -Reverse engineering existing client designs for product updates<br>

        <h4 style="padding-top:50px">Electronics Technician<br>
        Unites States Naval Reserve<br>
        DEC 2016 - Present</h4>
        <p>After spending six years around the globe as an active duty member of the US Navy, I decided to join the Naval Reserves. 
          Our monthly drill and yearly training schedule keeps me in tune with the industrial side of the electrical engineering world. 
          For two weeks each year, I travel to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to provide much needed support to the electrical workers there.</p>

        <h5>Responsibilities in the US Naval Reserve:</h5>
        <p>-Manage twenty-two reservists in daily activities during drill weekends<br>

        OCT 2016 - MAY 2018</h4>
        <p>The Bite in Tumalo is a food truck lot in a small community on the outskirts of Bend. 
          This job was an amazing way for me to resocialize with civilians after being in the Navy. 
          Because, lets be real, some veterans need that.</p>

        <h5>Responsibilities at The Bite:</h5>
        <p>-Interacted with customers on daily basis, demonstrating personable attitude and conflict resolution<br>

          Unites States Navy<br>
          DEC 2010 - DEC 2016</h4>
          <p>When I graduated highschool I didn't feel that I was equipped to make a career decision that would lock me into a path for the rest of my life. 
            So I decided to place that decision on hold and join the Navy. This was the best decision I could have made for myself, 
            I grew as a person and wouldn't trade the experience for the world.</p>

          <h5>Responsibilities in the US Navy:</h5>
          <p>-Lead thirteen personnel in day-to-day operations and systems maintenance<br>
            -Maintained records and log-keeping for accountability of maintenance and systems use<br>
