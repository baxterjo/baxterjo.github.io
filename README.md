# Portfolio Website

## Adding Content

To add a new page to the site in the `about`, `experience`, or `projects` tree in the website, add a new content directory to the corresponding location in the `site_content` directory.

### Images and Thumbnails

Thumbnails should have a 3:2 aspect ratio (or they won't show up well in the card galleries on mobile)

The location of assets should be in the `public/img` directory and follow the same file structure as the `site_content` directory.
