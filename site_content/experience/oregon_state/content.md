Oregon State is a fantastic school with a beautiful campus. Corvallis, Oregon is a small, amazing community that I wouldn't mind being a part of again one day.

#### Launch Velocity

Oregon State University's ECE program offers a practical, hands-on education in electrical engineering and computer science.

My experience here gave me much of the practical knowledge I needed to succeed as a fresh junior engineer in the tech industry. I also had the confidence to take on learning challenges on my own and become an independent member of a great engineering team.
