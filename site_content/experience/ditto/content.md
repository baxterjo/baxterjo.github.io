Ditto is an edge-native application sync service that ensures uptime for applications even without internet connectivity. With this SDK in your application you can be confident that if your internet goes out at a point of sale or on your manufacturing line, you will be able to continue operations as normal until internet is restored. At Ditto I have been a part of two very different teams, one focused on building applications for federal customers, and another on improving the networking stack of the SDK.

#### Federal Role - Staff Applications Engineer

My role on the federal applications team was to build an application that allowed other federal vendors to access the Ditto SDK via commonly use application layer protocols (OSI Layer 7). This involved working with other federal vendors to drive toward a common communication API and teaching them how to work with layer 7 protocols. Many of the other players in this space are not software engineers, or if they are they are usually fresh out of school. So patience and mentorship was a key component of this role.

#### Networking Role - Senior Networking Engineer

After a few months in my role on the federal side of the business management decided that the engineering organization needed to unify, rather than being siloed into commercial and federal sides of the business.
As a result I was given the opportunity to join a team focused on low level networking. Up until this point all of my experience had been with OSI layer 7, which in my opinion is an entirely different domain than anything below layer 7.
It is not often that someone this far along in their career gets to switch domains, so I jumped at the opportunity. I was the first to admit to my manager that I did not feel I could fulfil the role of a staff software engineer in this domain. So I pro-actively re-leveled to senior software engineer, retaining the same comp.
