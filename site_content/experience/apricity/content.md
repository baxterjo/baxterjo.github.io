Intern: February 2018 - June 2020

Full Time: June 2020 - September 2021

Apricity consulting was an IoT consulting firm that had a small catalogue of in house products. This position was an amazing start to my career, as it introduced me to so many varied concepts so fast. The start up atmosphere also allowed me to pace my career as fast as I could run.

#### Skills Learned

What didn't I learn here? I'll try to stick to the important stuff.

|   |  |
|---|---|
|Infrastructure as Code| AWS |
| CI/CD | Large Dataset Consumption  |
| Demand Response | Python  |
| Zephyr RTOS | Autodesk Eagle  |
| Manufacturing Optimization | Client Relations and Project Management |
| MQTT | LoRaWAN |
|Grafana|Systems Architecture|

#### Primary Responsibilities

My primary responsibility as Apricity was to develop and maintain the AWS serverless backend for an IoT energy [demand response](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/energy-efficiency-and-demand/demand-response) device. This device was LTE connected to AWS IoT core, where we could send operation schedules and receive telemetry for a fleet of over 7k devices. This backend would also manage firmware update and device lifetime management. The control of these devices were delegated to individual utilites, so our backend also had to expose and http API to allow those utilities to control their fleets. Being so involved with the lifetime of these devices (and being part of a startup) also demanded that I oversee the manufacture of devices and provisioning into AWS IoT Core. One of my final contributions to this program was a multi-fleet data aggregation system that assisted developers in adequately troubleshooting and diagnosing problems with devices in the field.

#### Secondary Responsibilities

As is the case with most startups, at Apricity, everyone wore many hats. So, when we needed to flex resources onto a project for our consulting side of the business, I was usually the first one to flex. I loved this aspect of my job. Because with every client project, I was able to learn something new and bring it back to my primary responsibility.

#### As Fast as I Can

Startups have their ups and their downs. But my favorite thing about working for a startup is this: **I consider myself to be a very fast learner, and this position gave me the opportunity to progress my career at the pace of my learning.**

I went from intern, to fresh grad developer, to being responsible for the cloud backend of an entire fleet of devices in a very short span.
