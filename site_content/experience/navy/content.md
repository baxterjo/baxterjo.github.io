Being in the Navy was a great experience for me. I got to travel the world, I lived in Japan for three years, and I got my education paid for. I also picked up a few skills that easily cross industry boundries.

My primary job in the Navy was to operate and maintain the Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS). This was a fully self contained defense system that had every domain of engineering packed into it. It has radar, control systems, cooling systems, ballistics, mechanical movement systems, and computers that controlled the whole thing. CIWS is a very maintenance demanding system that served as the basis for my troubleshooting expertise that I use on the job every day.

#### Leadership Experience

I had two secondary roles in the Navy, (talk about wearing many hats).

One of the secondary roles was to coordinate maintenance on the ship. When underway, the ship needs to ensure that certain quadrants of defense are always protected. My job was to ensure the smooth operation of maintenance of weapons systems on the ship while also ensuring that the defense quadrants were maintained.

The other secondary role was as a division leader (think manager or supervisor). I had to ensure that everyone in my division was able to do their jobs every day and resolve any issues that may have blocked them from doing so.
