Apricity consulting was aquired by Generac in September of 2021. At Generac I developed applications on an embedded Linux device that serves as a gateway for a whole home battery backup system. This was a greenfield device, and allowed me to see the full lifecycle of a product from inception to completion.

#### Primary Role

My primary role at Generac was to develop systems applications on an embedded Linux platform using the very popular [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language. These applications included telemetry collection, device firmware update for both host and edge devices, stateful alert monitoring as well as a whole host of other applications for IoT gateway devices.

Being on a gateway device team means many things. Importantly, it means that your system is a single point of failure in communications to systems in the field. This meant that the firmware on these devices had to be well tested and reliable before we were willing to ship them. Something I pride myself in is my commitment to quality in my work, so this task was not something I shied away from.

#### Secondary Role

While at Generac I was the unofficial dev-ops engineer on my team, as the project did not have a dedicated engineer for that position. I also mentored an intern for a summer while he was on break from college.
