#### ABOUT THE PROJECT

Our client had a working Bluetooth mesh light switch running on the CSR API. When CSR and BT SIG joined forces, our clients hardware and firmware went out of date. My task was to get the client's existing devices running on BT SIG mesh API. My task was to provide a proof of concept that the client could take to a conference to show off.

#### HACK IT

For this project, I was given the existing hardware for a light switch and a lighting control box. As well as the schematics for each. My task was to reverse engineer the existing design, and hack a new microcontroller into it. All while retaining original functionality. The above image is a qualcomm IoT development board flashed with custom firmware strapped to the back of the existing hardware with control wires running inside for I/O.

#### PRESENTABILITY

As mentioned above, this switch was destined for display at a conference. So, while functional, the bare board wouldn't cut it. Luckily, light switches are built in standard sizes, so a quick trip to the ACE Hardware down the road gave me a perfect enclosure.

#### DEMONSTRATION

How do you show people a light control box works without a light attached to it?
You figure it out!

Attached to the light control box (left) is a 120 VAC indicator light and voltmeter display for the 0-10V dimming control.

Since this project was done for a client, I am unable to show schematics or firmware. If you want to checkout something I can show, head over to my persistance of vision display project!
