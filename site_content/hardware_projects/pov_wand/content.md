#### ABOUT THE PROJECT

Persistence of vision is a principle that is used in most forms of visual display in Computer Engineering. We leveraged this principle to write text in thin air!

#### MEET THE TEAM

Meet Suyang Liu and Anthony Bishop, these two and I lived in the lab for two and a half weeks to get this thing going. Our message was not-so-subtle.

#### HANDHELD DESIGN

![](/img/hardware_projects/pov_wand/pov1.jpg)

We decided we wanted something that you could fit in your pocket, so we went with a very portable design that had an external battery. This whole project weighed less than a pound and could be carried around with ease.

#### ADVANCED SENSORS

The minimum requirement for this project was to use a potentiometer to tell the micro controller what to display. We thought that sounded clunky and didn't allow for enough freedom of movement. So we strapped an accelerometer to this bad boy to get advanced control schemes.

#### HAVE FUN

We also decided that, since we owned this project, we would make it fun. The enclosure design is modeled after an item in a popular video game!

#### CHECK IT OUT

Presentation is half the battle, if you can't get your ideas across to your audience then they will fall flat. This video presentation is our way of telling you exactly how we accomplished this task. If you want to dive into our documentation, check out our google folder.
