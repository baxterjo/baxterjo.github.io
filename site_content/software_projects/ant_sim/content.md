#### ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project was written as a final project to an antennas class in 2020. The prompt for the final project was pretty open ended, and I had been teaching myself python that entire quarter. So I decided to showcase what I had learned.

#### A "Simple" Antenna Simulator

This antenna simulator was one of my first GUI applications. It was a final project for an antennas class that has a pretty open ended prompt. So instead of building an antenna (like had been done a million times before) I decided to build a virtual antenna. The simulator uses Tkinter as it's GUI framework and renders plots using matplotlib. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/baxterjo/simple-antenna-simulator)!
